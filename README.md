# Verified-Product-Authenticity-Chain

ðŸ§¾ Project Title
Verified Product Authenticity Chain â€” A decentralized solution to register and verify the authenticity of products on the blockchain.

ðŸ“œ Project Description
This project leverages blockchain technology to ensure product authenticity and transparency in the supply chain. It allows manufacturers to register products and provides a tamper-proof system where only authorized verifiers (typically the contract owner) can validate the authenticity of a product.

Built on Core DAO using Solidity, the smart contract ensures that each product is uniquely identified, securely recorded, and verifiable by anyone.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
To create a transparent, trustless ecosystem where consumers and businesses can verify the authenticity of products, reduce counterfeiting, and increase confidence in supply chains using decentralized ledger technology.

ðŸš€ Key Features
-Product Registration: Register new products with a unique ID, name, and manufacturer.

-Ownership Control: Only the contract owner can verify products.

-Authenticity Verification: Track whether a product is verified and by whom.

-Immutable Records: Store product details on-chain for transparency and trust.

-Events Emission: Listen to blockchain events when products are registered or verified.

ðŸ”® Future Scope
âœ… Role-based access for multiple verifiers

âœ… Integration with QR code and RFID scanning

âœ… Front-end DApp for user interaction

âœ… On-chain product history tracking

âœ… Support for multiple blockchains (multi-chain deployment)

âœ… NFT-based product certificates for consumers
